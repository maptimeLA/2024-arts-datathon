He studied at the Jepson Art Institute and won the Good Design Award from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in 1955 for his innovative ceramic bird shelter. In the mid- 1950's he became interested in working on a larger scale and he sold off his pottery to devote a year to researching architectural ceramics. He designed art elements for several prominent Los Angeles landmarks such as the American Cement Company Building on Wilshire Boulevard and the Pomona College Clock Tower. Malcolm Leland currently lives in Arizona and recently had a 2007 solo show at the Cardwell Jimmerson Gallery.,"In 1957, as Modernist architect Richard Neutra designed Los Angeles County’s new Hall of Records building, he was approached by ceramicist Malcolm Leland with an innovative idea to wed artistic design with architecture. Art ornamentation had once been ubiquitous in architecture but had almost disappeared with the advent of the minimal twentieth century trends of Modernism and the International Style. Leland was a ceramic potter with no previous architectural experience, but he was greatly inspired by Oscar Niemeyer’s designs for Brasilia, the new capital city of Brazil. Built in the 1950s and 60s, Niemeyer’s architecture for the new city was in the Modern style but also incorporated artworks, including large-scale screens into some of his designs. Leland thought the same could be done in Los Angeles, ushering a new approach to the bare bones functionalism of Modernism.

Neutra was intrigued by Malcolm Leland’s ideas and asked him to investigate how a large-scale ceramic screen could be built. Leland visited Gladding, McBean, the well-known ceramic factory which had manufactured architectural terra cotta works before Modernism’s heyday. Gladding, McBean no longer made decorative pieces but still produced extruded terra cotta industrial forms (such as pipes). Leland decided to develop a terra cotta art object which could also be extruded. Neutra, Leland, and the Hall of Records’ engineer worked together to make Leland’s design structurally feasible. The final work consisted of one form, repeated hundreds of times and anchored to the building by metal hooks on steel rods. It concealed Neutra’s ventilation ducts while at the same time allowing air to flow freely. Leland’s form was also able to be attached in two ways, creating an interplay of texture and light. The overall work is nearly as tall as the building itself, covering eight stories.

He studied at the Beaux Arts Institute and the Art Student’s League in New York City, and served as an assistant to sculptors Frederick MacMonnies and Paul Manship before he began sculpting in the 1930s.

To ensure the authenticity of the uniforms worn by the U.S. First Dragoons, the New York Volunteers and the Mormon Batallion - the units witnessing the ceremony - Kreis was advised by noted California historians Glenn Dumke and Robert Cleland. Historic themes in the development of Los Angeles are symbolized in the other three reliefs: the uppermost represents the agricultural and spiritual foundation of the region; the middle panel depicts the transportation that shaped the city at the end of the 19th century; and the lower section contains an inscription written by the Department of Water & Power and portrays the crucial role that water, and electricity play in a large modern city.

On January 12, 1847, two days after United States troops occupied Los Angeles during the war with Mexico, construction of an adobe fort began on top of the hill where the Fort Moore Pioneer Memorial is now located. Completed by the Mormon Battalion, which arrived in Los Angeles in March, the fort was dedicated on July 4, 1847, and remained in service only until 1853, when it was decommissioned. It was named in memory of Captain Benjamin Davies Moore who was one of 21 Americans killed during the battle of San Pasqual near San Diego in December 1846. Though this battle, the largest in California during the Mexican-American War, was a military victory for the Californians led by Andres Pico, it failed to stop American forces from capturing Los Angeles a month later.

Argent saw parallels between the symbol of a puzzle piece and all the voices of a community. To hear individual voices firsthand, Argent spent a week in Willowbrook interviewing 32 local residents and encouraged the participants to tell their personal stories.

As a Studio, Ball and Nogues have completed designs and installations for the New York Museum of Modern Art / P.S. 1, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art and Materials & Applications. In the fall of 2008, they were invited to install their artwork, Echoes Converge, at the 2008 Architecture Biennial in Venice, Italy.","The two artworks at El Cariso Regional Park are in the tradition of land art, in which artists integrate natural materials like stones, concrete and landscaping in the design. 

Sylmar was once the site of the largest olive grove and mill in the world.

The project required soil testing, irrigation planning and conservation assessments.

Civic artworks at two parks and two libraries in these neighborhoods were intended to increase community pride and ownership of public assets and ultimately lead to the reduction of graffiti vandalism at county properties. The project team made additional investments in community engagement as a crucial element for project success. The project was designed create new cultural assets that would meet the needs of each site and test a new model to ensure that artists were fully supported to meet the demands of the project. The project team also embraced evaluation as a component of the project design.
In addition to permanent art installations and temporary artist-led engagement programs at each site, the project team produced a documentary video chronicling the development of each artwork and an evaluation report of findings and lessons learned from all four project sites.

It was created through Fernandez’s research and conversations with the local community and project architects. 
Fernandez was drawn to the history of the Dominguez family, the initial landowners of the area dating back to 1784. To learn more about this history and to connect with local residents, Fernandez and community engagement consultant, Sara Daleiden arranged a field trip and free tour of the Dominguez Rancho Adobe Museum. Only four miles from project site, the Dominguez Rancho is a California Historical Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For some, the field trip to the Rancho was their first.
During the tour they learned about important moments in the history of the community, including the 1910 Air Meet that happened at Dominguez Field and was the first major air show in the United States. Fernandez continued his conversations with the Community Center’s architects to understand their inspiration, which came from 1960s architecture. He learned that architecture from this time often incorporated wood and bold, colorful graphics. 
In the artwork you will find that the mission style architecture of the Rancho is referenced in the shape of the wood and vibrant metal panels throughout. Modern interpretations of the façade and hot air balloons from the 1910 Air Meet are incorporated. A wing-like symbol, painted in the background, is a recurring image in Fernandez’s work.
Local youth from the Los Angeles Conservation Corps were mentored by the artist and helped to complete portions of the installation. The artwork is a part of a series of projects funded by a grant from the Los Angeles County Parks and Regional Open Space District that use arts-based solutions to promote the value of civic spaces and deter vandalism at County properties. The artist hopes that the artwork will achieve this goal by creating a new cultural landmark that dramatizes community history, progress and place. </div>",Parks and Recreation,District 2 ,East Rancho Dominguez Community Center,15116 S.

Ceramic artist Juliana Martinez hand painted ceramic interpretations of masks featuring Pre-Columbian era gods. They are framed by 75 student made masks, creating the 9-feet by 8-feet mosaic tile mural in the health center lobby. Martinez intended the deities featured in the five large ceramic medallions to serve as guardians of health to students at the high school, who will visit the center for general wellness, dental, vision and mental health services.

To create the artwork, Martinez and San Fernando High School art teacher Heather Ambrosio led two workshops for students. Using their memory, imagination and clay, each student sculpted their own interpretation of masks based on their class lesson on “Masks of the Americas.” Exaggerated facial features commonly found in Pre-Columbian artifacts were added to either a student’s self-portrait or the likenesses of important people in their life.

The artwork consists of more than 3,000 terra cotta, glass, hand painted ceramic and Talavera tiles. Talavera tile, sometimes called azulejos, was brought to Mexico from Spain and also contains Portuguese, Dutch and Moroccan influences.

The work she creates ranges in scope from monumental pieces of bronze, stainless steel, aluminum, fiberglass and silicone as well as mixed media with projected imagery and sound. By sensitively examining the diametrically opposed yet essentially related configurations of natural elements and 21st century culture, she creates seductive juxtapositions of form and idea.
Her polished forms invoke a quiet sense of power. A power that isn’t self-referential, rather it draws upon both the primordial and mechanical to remind the viewer of the universal cycle of existence. Using cogent amalgams of compliments and opposites, her works create subtle relationships between nature and humanity, the technological and the organic, and the gentle way fragility has the capacity to overpower strength.
Taslitz sculptures infer a connection between natural objects and the invisible forces that shape the course of human life. This work conveys familiar human emotions – vulnerability, strength, connection and isolation with anthropomorphic forms from the natural world. She draws her inspiration directly from nature. Birth, death, renewal- the basic outline to the story of all human life; the beginning, the end and the struggle in between are ongoing narratives. These are themes that lay just beneath the surface of her work.
The artist currently resides in Los Angeles, California.","<em>Personal Archeology</em> is a wall relief sculpture depicting kelp that spans 20 feet in length. Featuring several kelp pods and 10 feet-tall leaves, the sculpture undulates up the wall and across the ceiling of the ramp from the first floor to the mezzanine level.

To gather inspiration for the artwork designs, artist Kathy Taslitz spent time in Manhattan Beach interviewing people in the historic Metlox Plaza and beachfront boardwalk near the library. A local historian provided Taslitz with insight on notable events that helped shape the character of Manhattan Beach. Extracted from her interviews with community members, words describing the city are embedded in the intricate pattern of the kelp leaves. Library visitors are encouraged to discover words in the leaves of the sculpture as they walk by and underneath it. A reservoir of words touching on significant points in the city’s history, traditions and natural surroundings—the sculpture is intended to encourage conversation and storytelling at the library.

To create this artwork, Taslitz first sculpted each of the seven kelp leaf and pod forms out of foam by hand. Next, metalworkers created a series of fiberglass molds from the sculpted foam forms to cast pieces of the sculpture in aluminum. Several smaller cast pieces were welded together, smoothed and refined to create a complete stem with pods and each of the seven leaf forms.

In reference to blue and white Portuguese and Spanish Azulejo tile, Mexican Talavera tile, and Chinese and Middle Eastern porcelain wares, Romero chose the reoccurring blue and white ceramic color composition to represent the city’s intense diversity and to highlight Dutch and Portuguese farmers who settled Artesia and the surrounding areas into flourishing dairy districts. 

The central female figure is meant to embody Artesian well water—the primary natural resource for early Artesian farming and dairy settlers. The water scroll motif woven throughout the pattern flows from the figure, underscoring the importance aquifer water played in the city’s growth. Each scene within the pattern highlights cultural landmarks, symbolic elements and traditions celebrated by generations of Artesians.

Built in 1974, the library was named after Madame AC Bilbrew, a community leader, poet and musician. Bilbrew, a pioneer in radio, was the first African American to have her own radio show in the United States. The building was designed by architect Vincent J. Proby and is also famous for housing the Black Resource Center that includes collections relevant to the social, historical and cultural aspects of African American history.
As part of the renovation, artist team Greenmeme was commissioned to develop an artwork for the interior courtyard. In keeping with the goals of the renovation library project, staff expressed their desire to integrate native landscaping into the design of the artwork. In addition, focus groups with the Friends of AC Bilbrew Library and local teens prompted a cross-generational exchange about how the library’s history could be made relevant to new audiences. 
Greenmeme also conducted a series of studies documenting the building’s architecture and the tiles that are prominently featured on the exterior. The pattern in the tiles became the inspiration for the design of gold ribbons that provide seating in the courtyard. Planters and a trellis were also added so that the courtyard would become an outdoor garden and gathering space that could host poetry readings, performances and discussions.
The artwork is a part of a series of projects funded by a grant from the Los Angeles County Parks and Regional Open Space District that use arts-based solutions to promote the value of civic spaces and deter vandalism at County properties.

Placed near the tee off area for the first hole, the sculpture features Bogie and Scratch perched on top of an oversized polished stainless steel golf tee holding up a plinko board. Bogie and Scratch invite golfers to drop their golf ball down the plinko board to help them decide the order which golfers will tee off before they start golf game. Bogie, named after the golf term meaning one shot more than par, represents the inexperienced golfer. Scratch’s name is derived from the term scratch golfer—someone who golfs at or better than par. Bogie and Scratch are meant to embody the idea that practice is the difference between a seemingly lucky and unlucky golfer.

These evolutions include early agricultural roots that afforded large, narrowly proportioned residential lots, the 105 freeway which permanently altered the firm boundary of the neighborhood, and the shifting cultural makeup of its residents. These evolutions and the distinctive ways that residents shape and support their community struck the artist, Rob Ley, as hallmarks to consider throughout the development of this large-scale artwork. The ideas supporting the evolution of the artwork elements began to coalesce around the resilience of the neighborhoods and people who live and work in the area. The phrase, “the strength of the individual can multiply and transform into the power of the many” had a particular resonance for the artist.
The artwork, <em>Endless Miles</em>, is a representation of the uniqueness of individual residents, as well as the groups and organizations that these individuals form in the community.

She believes that space (physical and physiological) has a fundamental, lasting impact on personal identity. While the environment around us is constantly evolving, photography has the power to capture humanity in a place, in a moment--transforming a flicker in time into a lasting, appreciable statement. Carla's work has been exhibited nationally and internationally in New York, Los Angeles, DC, Paris, and Quebec. She completed undergraduate coursework at the School of Visual Arts in New York, received her bachelor's degree with distinction from the University of Virginia, and her MFA from UCLA in 2015. She currently lives/works in Los Angeles. Her works are included in the collections of USC Fisher Museum; California African American Museum; Museum of Art and History, Lancaster, CA; The Museum of Fine Arts, Sherbrooke, Quebec; the Los Angeles Metro, General Mills; and numerous private collections.","Artist Carla Jay Harris was selected to create a site-specific artwork for the Multipurpose Room at the park. Harris designed a digital mural translated into a laminated vinyl that spans three walls above the stage of this room. Titled The Guardians, this work honors the community center as a safe harbor to inspire its community and visitors. Community centers have always functioned as a sanctuary for Carla Jay Harris, providing a safe space to connect with family, friends, and neighbors. Harris designed this site-specific mural in response to the unprecedented events of 2020 -a global pandemic, a contentious US presidential election, and racial unrest. The Guardians expresses the need to safeguard community and demonstrates how creativity in public spaces promotes healing and fosters a sense of belonging. The mural's central theme is conveyed by a pair of female guardians who bookend the space acting as both the beginning and the end of a circle of protection for the Willowbrook community. They oversee a pastoral park scene that includes several elements of the local environment, including native birds and plants, interspersed with mythological imagery. By blending aspects of reality and fantasy, the artist intends to evoke a feeling of a surreal oasis. In wrapping the ceiling of the multipurpose room at Earvin Magic Johnson Park, The Guardians seek to celebrate the community-driven revitalization of the Willowbrook neighborhood. Carla Jay Harris is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice incorporates installation, collage, and drawing. Her creative process often involves documenting the space we live in through intellectual, emotional, and psychological lenses. Each of her projects begins as an exploration of one aspect of her personal experience and then evolves into a more significant statement about human nature.

To learn more visit: http://www.phunghuynh.com/","Over 200 women who delivered babies at the Los Angeles County and USC Medical Center (now known as the Los Angeles General Medical Center) between 1968 and 1974 underwent sterilization procedures. The majority of these women were low income, born in Mexico, and were possibly coerced into receiving postpartum tubal ligations. These surgeries rendered them unable to become pregnant. Coerced sterilization is a shameful part of America’s, and Los Angeles County’s, history. It is necessary to acknowledge the irreparable harm inflicted on the women who were subjected to these coercions, as well as on their families. On August 7, 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors formally apologized to the women and families who were harmed by these practices. The Board instructed the Department of Health Services and the Department of Arts and Culture to design and install a civic artwork on the campus of LAC+USC Medical Center. The Department of Arts and Culture commissioned Los Angeles-based artist Phung Huynh to create the artwork, which was developed through a community engagement process. The artwork recognizes the women and their families, expresses the Board’s sincere apology for the County’s coerced sterilization practice, and reminds current and future generations that this tragedy must never occur again. The name of the artwork, Sobrevivir, is Spanish for to keep alive or survive. The 2015 documentary, No Mas Bebes, co-produced by scholar and UCLA lecturer Virginia Espino and directed by co-producer and filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pena, was pivotal in the artist’s research for this project and gave her access to listen and learn from the mothers themselves. Huynh was moved by both the courage and vulnerability of the mothers, and there were many points of inspiration for the artwork. One of the most important inspirations is the words of the survivors, which are featured on the wall surrounding the artwork; 

“If you speak English, they treat you one way. If you don’t speak English, they treat you another way.” 

“Yo, por dentro, siento mucha tristeza.” 

“Se me acabó la canción.” 

During the development of the final design, Huynh led an engagement process to inform the artwork concept and inspire a sense of community ownership. She worked with community members to create four quilts. Survivor’s family members and people with whom this experience resonated made each quilt square. This quilt represents a collective approach to healing through art and acknowledges and pays tribute to the survivors. Huynh was inspired by women’s craftwork such as weaving, sewing, and brocading, and she looked at the huipil, its strong, stoic form complimented by colorful patterns and flowers. She views flowers as important representations of fertility, as well as offerings, are included in the work. Many of the mothers relied on devotion and prayer to cope and heal. Central to the artwork is the hands of the Guadalupe, who in many ways is a powerful representation of Los Angeles. She also wanted the artwork to echo the cultural and artistic practices and traditions of Mexico where many of the mothers are from. In Mexico, leather tooling is a beautiful and highly skilled craft and the elegant markings on leather, which is ultimately skin, is symbolic of the mothers’ sobrevivir, their resilience, and how they transformed their suffering. The site for the artwork is a circular space that invites contemplation. Huynh created a powerful piece that invites viewers to learn about the mothers and connect with their experiences. The artwork is made of 32 panels of Corten steel that will rust and change over time. It is a living piece of art and of history that will grow and evolve with the community. On the surrounding wall are the words of the mothers. The choice of metal is deliberate to convey the strength, resilience, and sobrevivir of the survivors. The austere physicality of the metal is complemented by the effects of light.

His community-specific public projects integrate new forms of civic participation and social engagement into the built environment and reveal how the spaces we travel through and spend our time living within have the potential to become distinct sites for intimate, radical, and meaningful exchanges. Through his process, each project starts by creating temporary public spaces for listening-‘Outdoor Living Room’-as a way to capture voices from local people that might not attend more formal meetings. Stemming from this approach are experiences that involve people from a range of backgrounds working together to create new models of living that contribute to local culture beyond the economic realm. Mazzotta's public projects have received international art and architecture awards such as the Architizer A+ Award, Azure's AZ Award, The WAN Award, and six of his projects have been recognized by the Americans for the Arts. Last year, in particular, he won four of the major international Architecture awards, as well as, “Architecture Project of the Year” by the Dezeen Awards at the Tate Modern in London. Matthew’s work has been featured on CNN, BBC, NPR, The Huffington Post, Discovery Channel, and Science Magazine to name a few and presented at the Cooper Hewitt-Smithsonian Design Museum in NYC.

Samuel Goldwyn later hired Ballin as an art director for Goldwyn Pictures in New Jersey where he worked until 1920 when he formed his own production company, Hugo Ballin Productions. He relocated his company to Los Angeles in the mid-1920s. When talking pictures revolutionized Hollywood, Ballin quit the industry to return to painting (although he did provide sketches for The Wizard of Oz). He quickly became one of the foremost muralists in southern California.

In addition to painting and directing, he also wrote four successful novels.","This fresco ceiling mural at the entrance to the historic General Hospital, depicts real-life and mythological Greek medical heroes.

On his right and left, in the respective hearts of their sections, are Aesculapius’ sons, Podalirius and Machaon. Both were said to be miraculous healers who tended the wounded during the Trojan War. In addition to these fantastical men, Aesculapius is bordered by four real-life Greeks: Aristotle, Hippocrates, Herophilus, and Erasistratus. Each is famous for his contributions to the fields of philosophy or science. Podalirius and Machaon are surrounded by allegorical figures representing the emotional and practical qualities needed to care for and heal the sick.

All of the figures are set amongst a brilliant blue sky. Gold circles dominate throughout the artwork, adding to the round proportionality of the ceiling’s three domes and numerous arches.

The twelve pyramids are made of two shades of travertine stone, Desert Gold and Persian Red. They are arranged in a square with the red sculptures placed at the four cardinal points.

After serving as an Air Force illustrator in the 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles and attended East Los Angeles College. He received his B.A. from California State University, Los Angeles and later, his M.F.A. from Otis College of Art and Design. While pursuing education, Twitchell began to build his legacy as a large-scale muralist painting in a photorealist style. In 1971 and 1972, he completed some of his first public murals in Los Angeles, including the <em>Strother Martin Monument</em> and the <em>Bride and Groom</em> murals. He views his artwork as monuments to American cultural heroes.","These large-scale murals celebrate the lost murals by Helen Lundeburg painted in Patriotic Hall during the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1942. The Lundeburg murals depicted ""The Preamble to the Constitution,"" ""Free Assembly "" and ""Free Ballot.""

The spirit of both Lundeberg's content as well as style is strongly represented in the finished artwork.

Honoring the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs and service members’ commitment to preserving democracy, Twitchell used veterans, representing every U.S. tour of duty, as models for nearly all of the 36 figures in the murals. This project is Twitchell’s first public art commission by a governmental agency in his over 30 year career.

The site-specific sculpture, titled <em>Observation Post 1</em>, invites the public to frame their view of Pico Rivera. Evoking the seasonal changes as well as the maturation of the landscape, the sculpture will change over time.

To construct Observation Post 1, the artist used Corten steel or “weathering” steel. It is known as “weathering” steel because the weather causes a protective rust layer that forms during cycles of wet and dry weather. This intentional patina will evolve over time and go from a light orange color to a deeper orange-brown. Instead of having to paint the metal, the rust layer naturally protects the base metal from corrosion.

The sculpture contains a quotation by the French author Marcel Proust, with the sky as a backdrop: “The only true voyage of discovery would not be to visit strange lands, but to possess other eyes, to behold the universe through the eyes of another, of a hundred others–to behold a hundred universes that each of them beholds, that each of them is!”",Public Library,District 4 ,Pico Rivera Library,9001 Mines Avenue,Pico Rivera,California,90061,33.99187018,-118.0890633,382,77,FALSE

To incorporate the photographs into the artwork, Moody scanned and arranged them into nine thematic collages: King’s Vision, A Ray of Hope, Call and Response, Senior Power, Boy on Horseback, Care Giving, Welcome to the World, First Baby Born and Each One Teach One. Each collage constructs new narratives that inspire the viewer’s memory and connection to history. Fabricators printed the collages onto glass and mounted the glass within a framework created by repurposed windows and doors. Moody used additional items from various sources and flea markets throughout Los Angeles to add additional meaning. The patina, rust, weathered paint and darkened wood convey the passage of time.

All the elements were then secured to 1,500 year old redwood salvaged from a bridge in Bakersfield, California. The outline of the redwood frame forms a home.

The two artists with family ties to the Blanchard-Humphries community created an artwork that provides an aesthetic focal point with art elements for a hillside stabilization project at Eastern Avenue Hill.

The three handcrafted stone sculptures, or steles, are six feet high by two and half feet wide and feature imagery of native vegetation, iconography and stories of the neighborhood.

Acknowledging the power of storytelling, the artists hosted an engagement program to bring together residents, local artists and experts in an oral history exchange. Together, participants created a temporary artwork using weaving techniques, mixed media and native plants to reflect a visual story of their neighborhood. Significant memories of the river, pond, wild horses, frogs and the industrial developments that altered the natural ecology of the area and the social history of East LA are reflected in the artwork.

Tablet of the Elements pays homage to the four elements, fire, air, water and earth; Tablet of the Agave provides a historical survey of the area’s inhabitants, flora and fauna and industrialization; and Tablet of the Creation features a tree of life sprouting from the urban grid, referencing the Los Angeles basin.

The artists’ design for the hillside also includes a field of agaves and a customized decorative fence. Unfortunately, the stelae were repeatedly vandalized after their installation.

The work she creates ranges in scope from monumental pieces of bronze, stainless steel, aluminum, fiberglass and silicone as well as mixed media with projected imagery and sound. By sensitively examining the diametrically opposed yet essentially related configurations of natural elements and 21st century culture, she creates seductive juxtapositions of form and idea.
Her polished forms invoke a quiet sense of power. A power that isn’t self-referential, rather it draws upon both the primordial and mechanical to remind the viewer of the universal cycle of existence. Using cogent amalgams of compliments and opposites, her works create subtle relationships between nature and humanity, the technological and the organic, and the gentle way fragility has the capacity to overpower strength.
Taslitz’ sculptures infer a connection between natural objects and the invisible forces that shape the course of human life. This work conveys familiar human emotions – vulnerability, strength, connection and isolation with anthropomorphic forms from the natural world. She draws her inspiration directly from nature. Birth, death, renewal- the basic outline to the story of all human life; the beginning, the end and the struggle in between are ongoing narratives.

The bulbous forms—commingling with their tentacles extended, connecting with their neighbors—are meant to embody the act of individuals and families joining to form a community.

West’s artwork is part of her ongoing exploration of spaces in her past that felt peaceful and soothing.

,2018.14.4.a-b,"Rodriguez, Ana M",Untitled,Painting,Acrylic and oil paint on canvas,2017,24,20,"Ana Rodriguez is a Los Angeles multidisciplinary artist from South East Los Angeles. She is a painter, sculptor and art educator, serving South East LA youth. Rodriguez grew up in the small community of Maywood, California, which is adjacent to the industrial cities of Commerce and Vernon and their numerous chemical plants, refineries, public waste areas and foundries. The monochromatic industrial landscape and the variety of smells that were ever-present were a constant source of fascination. There was tar, sulfur, the sweet bakery scents from the Sarah Lee Bakery, the tangy odors from Mojave Spices, the pungent scent of roasted beans from Gavina Coffee, and the repulsive odors from the fat rendering factories that breakdown animal carcasses. Rodriguez recalls being highly aware of the contrast between the putrid, foul smell of dead animals and the sweet scents from bakeries and cake shops. She also cites imagery from the Tales of the Arabian Nights as an important source of inspiration. Descriptions of beautiful landscapes, sultans’ palaces, and genies are important source material as are Islamic patterns and Arabesque motifs, some of which the artist recalls from her childhood, in the form of kitchen cabinet liners, linoleum flooring or wallpaper. The mix of sources is reflected in Rodriguez’s paintings which combine brightly colored geometric patterns with swirling gestures in brown and grey. Ana Rodriguez earned a BFA from California State University, Long Beach (2007) and an MFA from Otis College of Art and Design (2009). Her work was included in Wet Paint: 10 Young LA Painters, Steve Turner Contemporary (2009).

Born in Los Angeles to Mexican parents, she spent her childhood living downtown near Temple Street. In 1957 she received a BFA from USC. The ethnic diversity of Los Angeles, as well as her extensive travels and study of world religions and ancient art at USC, led to the development of her pan-cultural style. De Larios’ public works include sculptures in Hawaii, New Jersey, Florida, Tahiti, Japan, and numerous cities in southern California. She has also created a ceramic dinner place setting for the White House.

One of the disks was also included in a 2018 retrospective exhibition of the artist at the Main Museum in downtown Los Angeles. De Larios was always drawn to the complete and strong simplicity of the circle as a form. She retold the story over and over again about her travels to Mexico City when she was very young (around 6 or 7) where she saw the giant Aztec stone calendar at the National Museum of Anthropology. She said when she saw it “I realized I was part of it, and it was part of me.” It affected her in a profoundly deep way, she knew at that moment she was an artist, connected to the past and the earth. The circle as a form was imprinted on her from that experience in Mexico. Dora had a keen eye for form from a design standpoint and repeatedly expressed love for circle as a complete form. It represented unity, the circle of life and completeness to her. This artwork complements the artwork in the lobby of the library, also by De Larios and created when the library first opened in 1978.

Her images are correspondingly dynamic: they depict select everyday moments in the working life of the Santa Clarita firefighter.

A fire station is both a place of work and a home. As such, the artworks for Fire Station 104 are large fused glass panels sited to address both the public spaces of the fire station and the places dedicated to the fire station staff.

While the three main artworks form a large triptych that can be read loosely as one scene, each window has its own subject and focus. On the left, a firefighter with a hose leans in the same direction as visitors entering the Station Lobby; the firefighter sprays water from a hose onto a controlled burn, grey clouds billowing up to the sky. In the central window, a pine tree glows with embers and touches of flames on its branches; the smoke of wildfires will often reflect the colors of flames and fire engine lights, which is depicted in a background of pinks and reds. The rightmost window shows an LA County Fire helicopter dropping sheets of water onto flames; it is an image that instills the idea of teamwork and shows the powerful resources of the LA County Fire Department. The firefighters’ Day Room is often kept dark for teaching or for watching movies. In this space, another triptych of windows shows a dramatic night fire scene with a smoldering yucca plant. The fiery yucca is an image the firefighters come across often in the arid climate of Santa Clarita. Yucca plants have to be dug out after being burned by a wildfire because they will stay hot and full of embers for days—firefighters call them ""hot pineapples."" In the fire station tower, three windows each on the North and East facades display the station’s numbers on a background the colors of a Santa Clarita sunset.

Addressing the issues of mental illness, substance use disorders, homelessness, and clinical needs, this project provides a mix of residential, outpatient, and support services to fill major gaps in the continuum of care within South Los Angeles. Artist Cliff Garten was selected to create an artwork for the exterior façade. Water provides an image of hope and renewal. The image of a stream or river in the artwork suggests the ease with which the community will be able to interact with the MRTBHC facility, seeking help and hope through its services and rising above the obstacles of everyday life. While the stream that that gave Willowbrook its name is no longer visible because of urbanization, we still understand the brook or water as a symbol for the identity of Willowbrook and for the cleansing and healing power of water. The project recalls the steams and springs that once fed Rancho La Tajuata, the land-grant that became Willowbrook, to create an art piece that captures the role of the Health Center in helping people toward adaptation and resilience. Water to Wishes draws inspiration from the wishes of the community expressed during community engagement and the image of water as a form of identity and an image of healing for the Mark Ridley Thomas Behavioral Health Center. The water columns are iconic markers, and their texts embody the many voices of the of the MRTBHC and its mission of healing in the Willowbrook community.

The glass is solid but transparent - a metaphor for how one can see past challenges and move forward towards positive change.

Mural Environments strongly believes in the healing value of art.","Located in the heart of Lennox, east of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Lennox Park is an energetic and popular place for community members of all ages. Through a partnership between the Office of Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, the Los Angeles County Parks & Recreation Department, the Los Angeles County Arts Commission’s Civic Art Program and Create Now, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit focused on social change through the arts, more than 100 community members had a hand in producing an over 1,200 square foot mural titled, “Lennox Past, Present and Future,” 

Create Now hired local muralist and educator Roger Dolin to conduct two drawing workshops and facilitate the mural making process with members of the community. During the workshop, participants were encouraged to design and paint their vision of Lennox. Virtually every image in the mural originates from one of the over 80 drawings produced by Lennox community members. Dolin worked with a core of more than 30 participants, primarily youth between the ages of 6 and 20. During the process residents were encouraged to help with the painting, observe and comment on the mural.

In an effort to feature the best qualities of the Lennox community and convey hope for the future, themes of environmentalism, sustainability and health were integrated in the artwork. The park pool, basketball court, and jungle gym reflect those important hubs of activity in Lennox. The jacaranda, the airplane, the food vendor and the postman are also defining elements of the park and the entire Lennox community.

Artist, Roger Dolin explains the mural’s visual entry point in outer space. “I liked the idea of Lennox Park from close up and from far away, showing that the people of Lennox are a part of a micro community, but a also a part of the rest of the world.” According to Dolin, outer space and the distant hills convey “Lennox as part of the whole world. It has a history as well as a future and people came from all over to be here.” The micro and macro perspectives also reinforce the theme of environmentalism, which starts locally, but has a global impact.""",Parks and Recreation,District 2 ,Lennox Park,10828 Condon Ave.,Inglewood,California,90660,33.93735909,-118.3589479,461,93,FALSE

Del Hoyo and Russell’s collaboration was formed on the idea of hybridizing mural painting processes and techniques with an emphasis on social engagement.

The artists produced community events for Dockweiler Beach patrons and created a mural with them. MobileMuralLab put on two spectacular, interactive events called Nite-Write during the summer of 2012. The events took place at night, the artists lured participants with glow in the dark paint and let people write their names and where they come from all over the MobileMuralLab truck, a former search and rescue truck with big blank sides.

The information gathered from participants, including what they liked to do at the beach, informed the design of the mural. Painted over several weeks, the mural was a true collaborative effort. The artists estimated that 1,500 people participated in the events and the mural painting (or both).

Dockweiler Beach is the only County beach that still has fire pits and is open late. The mural is a striking landmark during the day and glows in the dark at night.

Mural Painting Process: 

First layer: youth-based aerosol art groups mentored by master graffiti artists painted script words gathered from Nite-Write in a palette of blue and green - the collage of words resembling the ocean. 

Second layer: overlapping the abstract blue and green script, MobileMuralLab painted in block text using a traditional hand sign painting method known as electro-pounce to create an interesting contrast between organic and geometric type forms. The words spell out Isidore Bernard Dockweiler, a politician born in 1867 who advocated for public parks and beaches and for whom this beach is named. 

Third layer: delicate drawings of ammonite fossils hand-painted in UV paint that glows in the dark. Ammonites are the most common fossil found on every continent - representing the geographic diversity of people who come to Dockweiler Beach.

Her time abroad sparked an ongoing conversation between old and new, tradition and relevance, elevated and mundane, practical and spiritual. Living and working in southern California has also informed her work which has become increasingly more animated, incorporating anthropomorphization and bright saturated colors. With a background in graphic design and art direction, her eye tends to focus on patterns and her canvasses can take many forms. She is interested in seeing how her work plays with environment and interacts with the viewer. ","Kuroki was commissioned to design a mural on the ceiling of the main archway of the park office at Los Robles Park, emphasizing its most significant architectural feature. Kuroki chose a dynamic pattern and bold colors for her mural, to welcome and draw park visitors in to the playground and splash pad just beyond. The ceiling painting becomes a window to the sky–a safe door to the unknown. It also references The Beatles: “Lucy in the sky with diamonds/The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.” The colors resemble the cool colors of what is actually above the ceiling and it’s an invitation to not be limited. Be a diamond in the sky. <div>To learn more visit: <a href=""http://www.JenKuroki.com"">http://www.JenKuroki.com</a><div><div><br /></div><div></div></div></div>",Parks and Recreation,District 1 ,Los Robles Park,14906 Los Robles Avenue,Hacienda Heights,California,90706,34.01039665,-117.9857941,471,95,FALSE
